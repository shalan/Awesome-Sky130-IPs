# Awesome-Sky130-IPs
## Analog and Analog Mixed Signals (AMS)
### PLL/DLL
- [x8 PLL Clock Multiplier](https://github.com/lakshmi-sathi/avsdpll_1v8): x8 Clock Multiplier.
- [Phase Locked Loop (PLL)](https://github.com/Pramod-Krishna/PLL-Design-using-SKY130): A PLL is a negative feedback control system that generates an output clock signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input clock signal. A PLL can be used to multiply a low-frequency external reference clock (generated by a crystal oscillator) up to the operating frequency of the processor.
