## Analog and Analog Mixed Signals (AMS)
- [Phase Locked Loop (PLL)](https://github.com/Pramod-Krishna/PLL-Design-using-SKY130): A PLL is a negative feedback control system that generates an output clock signal whose phase is related to the phase of an input clock signal. A PLL can be used to multiply a low-frequency external reference clock (generated by a crystal oscillator) up to the operating frequency of the processor. 
- [Potentiometric Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)](https://github.com/vsdip/avsddac_3v3_sky130_v1): A 10-bit potentiometric DAC with 3.3v analog voltage, 1.8v digital voltage and 1 off-chip external voltage reference.
- [Potentiometric Digital to Analog Converter (DAC)](https://github.com/xzlashutosh/avsddac_3v3): Another 10-bit potentiometric DAC.
- [Analog Comparator](https://github.com/vsdip/avsdcmp_3v3_sky130): A 3.3V analog comparator.
- [Analog Comparator](https://github.com/maherbenhouria/caravel_user_project_analog): CMOS Rail-To-Rail Comparator
- [8-bit SAR ADC](https://github.com/chrische-xx/caravel_user_project_analog): 8-bit Successive Approximation Analog to Digital Converter with offset calibration.
- [1.0V BGR](https://github.com/mabrains/Analog_blocks/tree/main/Analog_Blocks/Bandgap): 1V Bandgap Voltage Reference.
- [0.7V BGR](https://github.com/hishamelreedy/BandGapReference_sky130): 0.7V Bandgap Voltage Reference.
- [1.8V LDO](https://github.com/mabrains/caravel_user_project_ldo): 100mA 1.8V Low Dropout Voltage Regulator.
- [1.8V Buck Converter](https://github.com/westonb/open-pmic): A current mode buck converter on the SKY130 PDK.
- [LDO, Power Swicth and BGR](https://gitlab.com/skywater130/columbus/-/tree/master/ip)
- [VCO ADC](https://github.com/duyhieubui/caravel_vco_adc): Voltage COntrolled Oscillator Based Analog to Digital Converter

- [OpAmp](https://github.com/MadhuriKadam9/caravel_avsdopamp_3v3_sky130_v2): 2-stage, frequency-compensated OpAmp
- [OpAmp](https://github.com/diegohernando/caravel_fulgor_opamp): General-Purpose OpAmp.
- [2-stage OpAmp](https://github.com/rohinthram/opamp_tapeout_mpw4): A Two Stage CMOS Operational Amplifier 
- [OpAmp](https://github.com/H-S-S-11/caravel_user_project_analog/tree/main/mag/zeroToASIC_integration):
